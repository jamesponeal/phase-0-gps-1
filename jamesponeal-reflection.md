This is my reflection for my first guided pairing session, GPS 1.1:

Answer these questions in your reflection:

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Prior to this session I think I was stuggling the most with using the fetch and merge commands. Last week I had been using "pull" which does both fetch and merge simultaneously.  I also didn't understand that I had to delete my branches from my local git session on my machine.  All through week one, I had been just deleting them from GitHub.  My pair mentioned deleting them locally from my command line, and a light bulb turned on in my brain.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
For me, fetching, merging, and managing local branches were clarified.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I don't know if my pair and I asked each other specific questions, but we worked really well together and I felt like there was a good sharing of knowledge and collaboration between the two of us.  We did ask the guide to help us explain how git tracks changes.  His explanation was much more detailed than ours.

What still confuses you about git?
Right now I think that I have a good handle on git, but I'm sure as I get into working on more complicated things with many files and collaborators I will be confused by some things.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was really good and helped me better understand git and GitHub.  It went really smooth and I'm looking forward to the rest of the peer-pairing and GPS sessions.
